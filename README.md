## üöÄ Get Started

This project was created using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Below is a guide on the common commands you might use all throughout the development process. In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn install`

Installs all package dependencies of the app. Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed and configured first.

#### `yarn build-ts`

Transpiles all of the `.ts` files from the `src/` directory into `.js` CommonJS files. This also "franks" the dist folder by copying the `package.json`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` files into it. The target directory is in the `dist/` folder.

> **_NOTE:_**  When publishing this module, make sure you publish the "franked" `dist/` directory instead of the root directory. This is so projects can cleanly import from the subfolders of this module.

#### `yarn lint`

Launches the linter against all of the `.ts` files from the `src/` and `test/` directory. The project specifically uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as the linter and code formatter, respectively.

#### `yarn test:unit`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode using Jest. The test is launched against all of the `.ts` files from the `test/` directory.
